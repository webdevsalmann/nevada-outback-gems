        description: "The beautiful Turquoise listed below was all taken from the McGuinness turquoise Mine in Lander County, Nevada. These stones are all natural and untreated gem quality American Turquoise collected by the claim owner (me). No one can offer a stronger guarantee of natural authenticity, as we have owned our turquoise from the time it left the ground. The McGuinness mine is located about 10 miles NE of Austin, in the center of the state of Nevada. Turquoise was first found in this area in 1930. After the initial discovery, the property was purchased worked periodically on a small scale by Mr. George McGuinness of Oakland, CA during the 1930s and 1940s.  Most of the workings at that time were underground with a few small surface pits. Later, it was worked on a much larger scale by mechanized equipment in the 1960s and 1970s and produced large amounts of very high grade, deep blue turquoise.  All of the turquoise offered here is completely natural, high quality, un-backed gem turquoise that has not been treated, and does not need treatment. We are here to meet the needs of the discriminating turquoise collector and jewelry artist. These stones represent the very best grade of natural turquoise that is available.",

Royston is located roughly 15 miles NW of Tonopah in central Nevada. These stones are all natural and untreated gem quality American Turquoise collected by the claim owner (me). No one can offer a stronger guarantee of natural authenticity, as we have owned our turquoise from the time it left the ground. The Royston District is one of Nevada’s better known turquoise-producing areas with the Royal Blue, the Bunker Hill, and the Oscar Wehrend being the three most important mines. The Bunker Hill was first discovered in 1927 by Bert Kopenhaver, and the initial workings were all underground. Royston turquoise can be unbelievably beautiful, with colors varying from different shades of green, dark sky blue to green and blue together in one stone. The matrix can be a beautiful brown and the best Royston is equal to that found in any American mine. All of the turquoise offered here is completely natural, high quality, un-backed gem turquoise that has not been treated, and does not need treatment. We are here to meet the needs of the discriminating turquoise collector and jewelry artist, and we hope you will find that special stone for you next great project right here.

The striking periwinkle blue of Tanzanite has become a well recognized and very popular gem in recent years. Our Tanzanite is bright and impressive, and we are offering some very fashionable, unique and  beautiful jewelry at an unbeatable bargain price. Tanzanite is actually quite rare and the world's only commercially important deposit is located in the Merelani Hills near Arusha, Tanzania. While the deposit continues to produce, the miners have to go deeper and deeper into the dangerous mines to extract these beautiful crystals. A syndicate by the name of Tanzanite One, styling itself after the De Beers diamond corporation, has taken control of the majority of  the deposit and is now offering tanzanite rough only to a few selected sight holders. They also purchase the majority of the rough produced by the small scale miners working in the area. Their control has led to a reduced supply and regularly, significantly increasing prices. There is now a scarcity of tanzanite available to the public, except through the approved, Tanzanite One controlled channels. Many individuals have chosen to invest some significant money in Tanzanite as increasing prices do seem likely in the future. With the higher prices, it is important for buyers to be careful. Unscrupulous dealers from Asia and other distant countries have offered simulated stones as if they were the real thing, including a cubic zirconia stone colored to look like tanzanite.  We know that our stones are authentic as we purchased them in their natural rough crystal form, just as they were mined in Tanzania, and have had them cut and polished ourselves we actually do have tanzanite crystals for sale as well.",
